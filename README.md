# Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable All-in-One

### Instruction: Run the included `install.bat` with admin privileges (right click, `Run as administrator`)

The download includes the VC_Redist runtime packages for Visual C++ 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2022. Both 32-bit and 64-bit are supported. The files included are the English language version.

When doing a Windows install, it's recommended to always install all the various C++ runtimes, which is why this all-in-one pack was created. It helps to avoid problems with programs that cause error messages like "side-by-side configuration is incorrect", or "Missing MSVCRT.DLL", "VCRUNTIME140_1.dll", or "MSVCP140.DLL".

This package is created by us here from [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Latest Supported Downloads](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist). All files are digitally signed by Microsoft, which guarantees they are unaltered.
